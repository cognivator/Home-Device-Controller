This is the first attempt at using node.js as a controller for my home automation.
I started with a simple function to connect to the Yamaha RX650 but have made the best progress on the Pentair pool controlling features.

Current package requirements:
(node.js - of course)
    npm install express
    npm install request
    npm install xml2js

Usage:
* install node.js and the packages
* Execute >node main.js
* GET and POST according to the descriptions in the main.js file
